# School_District_Analysis
## Purpose
To analyze school district data and find correlation between performance and different facets.

## Results
- In district summary, the overall passing percentage of district summary went down by 0.27% which is really not that much.
- In school summary, Thomas High School's overall passing percentage went way up: from 65.07% to 90.58%!
- Thomas High School is now ranked second in the district due to dropping the 9th grade scores.
- In terms of math and reading school by grade, since only the ninth grader scores were taken out, no other ratio is really affected by it. It does, however, leave us with an NaN cell in the data frame.
- Scores by school spending didn't change much at all.
- The overall passing percentage of scores by school size went down by a little less than 1%.
- The overall passing percentage of scores by school type was affected the most. The district average remains the same but the charter average went up a little over 3%!

## Summary
Overall it seems as though the ninth graders who supposedly cheated did very poorly on the tests and that's why after their scores were taken out the performance of Thomas High School shot up. As a result, they are placed #2 based on performance of 15 schools.<br />
Based on other statistics, it seems that district schools and large schools perform a lot worse than their counterparts with the average passing percentage of the least budgeted school (<$584 per student) being the highest! In terms of grade levels, it's hard to see a correlation as all the percentage fall between 80-84% across the board.
